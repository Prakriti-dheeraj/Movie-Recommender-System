# Movie-Recommender-System
ðŸ“¦ Code Block Overview
The code block in the movie-recomended-system.ipynb notebook is designed to implement a movie recommendation system. Here's a theoretical breakdown of its components:

Importing Libraries:
The code begins by importing essential Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, and sklearn for machine learning algorithms.

Loading the Dataset:
It reads the movie dataset into a DataFrame, which includes information like movie titles, genres, and user ratings.

Data Preprocessing:
The dataset undergoes cleaning and preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features to prepare the data for modeling.

Feature Engineering:
New features are created to enhance the model's performance. This may include combining existing features or extracting new ones from the data.

Model Training:
The preprocessed data is used to train a recommendation model. Techniques such as collaborative filtering or content-based filtering may be employed to learn user preferences.

Generating Recommendations:
Once trained, the model predicts and generates a list of recommended movies for users based on their preferences and viewing history.

Evaluation:
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or RMSE to assess its effectiveness in making accurate recommendations.

Visualization:
The results, such as top recommended movies or evaluation metrics, are visualized using plots and charts to provide insights into the model's performance.
